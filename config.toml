[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text="""Hi, I am Sumera. I am a CS undergrad and a Data Scientist from IIIT-Bhubaneswar.
  I mostly write Python at work but being a programming language enthusiast I also dabble in
  multiple programming languages-  Ruby and C being two of them. Currently I am learning Rust. Apart from
  Data Science, another CS domain that thoroughly fascinates me is Operating Systems. I also contribute to
  the linux kernel, here is a link to my [patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git/log/?h=staging-next&qt=author&q=sumera).

  When I am not programming I like to read, bake, or paint.

  Besides open source development I have some industry experience working as a Data Science intern
  for one of the top telecom firms. If you are looking for an aspiring polyglot developer for junior
  data scientist /ML  positions then you can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumera-priyadarsini-3b5259129/). I am also open to exploring other
  software engineering domains, it doesn't strictly have to be Data Science.
