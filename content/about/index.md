Hi, I am Sumera. I am a CS undergrad and kernel engineer from Bhubaneswar.
I used to write Python at work but being a programming language enthusiast I also dabble in multiple programming languages- Ruby and C being two of them.
Currently I am learning Rust and Ocaml. 

Apart from programming languages, another CS domain that thoroughly fascinates me is Operating Systems. 
I also contribute to the Linux kernel, here is a link to my [patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git/log/?h=staging-next&qt=author&q=sumera).

When I am not programming I like to read, bake, cook, or paint.

Besides open source development I have some industry experience working as a Data Science intern for one of the top telecom firms in the country.

Soon after, I started contributing to the Coccinelle tool which is used in the Linux Kernel.
Currently, I am working as a kernel intern under the [Outreachy scholarship](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) for the dri-devel system of the Linux Kernel. 
If you are looking for an aspiring polyglot developer for positions in kernel development/low-level backend systems then you can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumera-priyadarsini-3b5259129/). You may also reach me at sumera priyadarsini at gmail.
